  mistakeExplanation: Baljeet's email domain was correct, I would suggest re-reading
    the criteria.
  correctActionHint: Replying to this email was the correct decision
  consequenceText: Baljeet not getting permission to the drive again caused him to
    miss his deadlines and when management looked into it they saw you didn't give
    him his permission back.
